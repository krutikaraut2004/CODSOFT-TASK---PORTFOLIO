# PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
This is my personal portfolio website that I designed and built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences. The website is a reflection of my passion for web development and design, and it represents both my technical abilities and creativity.
